## 🎵 Alternative Audio Analysis APIs

Since Spotify deprecated their audio features and analysis endpoints, we've integrated multiple alternative APIs to enhance your Wrapped experience:

### 1. SoundStat.info API
**Primary replacement for Spotify audio features**

- **Features**: Danceability, energy, valence, tempo, acousticness, instrumentalness
- **Format**: Compatible with Spotify's original format
- **Coverage**: 3M+ analyzed tracks
- **Pricing**: Free tier available

### 2. AcousticBrainz
**Enhanced genre and mood analysis**

- **Features**: Genre classification, mood detection, musical characteristics
- **Coverage**: 7.5M+ recordings with comprehensive analysis
- **License**: CC0 (Public Domain)
- **Format**: Rich JSON with low-level and high-level features

### 3. Last.fm API (Optional)
**Social music insights**
